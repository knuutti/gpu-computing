## GPU Computing
This repository consists of my solutions for weekly assignments for a course "GPU Computing" lectured in LUT University.

---
### Requirements
For running the codes that require GPU, you will need Cuda installed on your device. Alternatively you can use environments such as Google Colab for running the codes.

### About the course
The aim of the course is to learn GPU-acceleration on three different levels of abstraction: 
1. In the lowest level by using CUDA programming language,
2. in mid-level by using readily available GPU-accelerated libraries and
3. in high-level using GPU-accelerated functions provided by a common deep learning framework (PyTorch).
